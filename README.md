# From Zero to Production in Rust code-along

This repository tracks my code-along to Luca Palmieri's [From Zero To Production In Rust][zero2prod].
At least one significant variation is that I will be using [axum][axum] instead of [actix_web][actix_web].
Both are built on top of [tokio][tokio] and [hyper][hyper], so the difference is likely minor.
